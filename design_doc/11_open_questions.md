# 11 — Open Questions

Only **unanswered** questions live here, ordered by how much each one blocks or shapes the design.
When a question is answered, write the answer into the relevant doc (requirement, decision, or format doc) and
**delete it from this file**. If it's partly answered, cut it down to the part that's still open.
IDs are never reused or renumbered, so gaps are expected. **Answer by ID.**
Answered IDs are not kept here: grep the ID in the spec docs (OQ-38..66 are summarised in [02](02_functional_requirements.md) "Maintainer decisions", OQ-68..78 and OQ-79..113 right after it, each with the doc that holds the rule).


## Needs outside input

**OQ-39 Terrain height for the bailout "> 30 m above ground" test** (owner: maintainer, will try to get heightmaps)
Rufus's rule checks the pilot's teardown height against a heightmap; il2ks has no terrain data for the Korea maps. When heightmaps arrive
(and their licence allows shipping them), add the height arm to bailout rule v3 (doc 13). Until then rule v3 stays as built.

## Needs the maintainer's review

**OQ-105 Achievements: names, tiers and thresholds**
Default applied: the 12 achievements, their names, tier counts and thresholds as listed in [17](17_achievements.md) (its "Decisions" section holds the
product calls). Not repeated here. Needs the maintainer's review of every name and number.

## Lower impact (owner: maintainer, outside input)

**OQ-26 Live telemetry for positions (Tacview-style)**
Does the IL-2 Korea DServer (or the client) offer a live telemetry feed or recording, such as Tacview real-time telemetry or ACMI export? Is it
reachable from the server machine, and can its object IDs be mapped to log object IDs? This only matters for a future flight-path map (TD-08).

**OQ-25 Payload data: weapon mods and gaps** (owner: maintainer, will extract the remaining payloads)
Is there a source for `WM` weapon-modification names, like the payload file? Unknown payloads still occur after game updates. (The F-51D 54–58 row shift is fixed.) Pages must keep working with unknown payloads (they show the raw ID). (Redistribution is settled: the payload file
ships in the repo, doc 12.)

**OQ-1 Config keys that enable text logs in Korea's DServer `startup.cfg`** (owner: maintainer, will ask server operators)
`il2ks doctor` needs them to detect and explain a missing setting. In BoS it was `mission_text_log = 1` and `text_log_folder`.
